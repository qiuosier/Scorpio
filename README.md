# Project Scorpio
Microsoft OneNote Add-in to save OneNote page as Markdown file.

This repository contains the source code generated by the [Yo Office generator](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office)

This Add-in uses the Turndown Javascript package to convert the OneNote page to Markdown format.

## Try It Out
The Add-in requires a web server. To run it locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate into the Scorpio folder, which contains the `package.json` file.
    ```
    cd Scorpio
    ```
3. Install dependencies.
    ```
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the local web server.
    ```
    npm run dev-server
    ```
5. In [OneNote on the web](https://www.onenote.com/notebooks), open a notebook and create a new page.

6. Choose *Insert* > *Office Add-ins* to open the Office Add-ins dialog. Then select the *MY ADD-INS* tab to upload the `manifest.xml` in the Scorpio folder.

7. In the *Home* tab, click on the *Scorpio Markdown* button in the ribbon. This will open the add-in task pane to show the markdown.
